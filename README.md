## Software: Rick and Morty Match Game and Gallery
## About
This project is a Single Page Application (SPA) built using React to create a memory matching game, complete with a character gallery and structured navigation bar. It demonstrates core React concepts for state management, component uses, and API calls.
- Match Game
- Character Gallery

## Match Game
The match game is a simple 8-card match game in which the cards flip to reveal the picture of a Rick and Morty character underneath.
Unsolved Problem: 
- Getting the cards to shuffle upon refresh.
- Data pull from API GET Method rather than from the URL


## Gallery
Gallery (Gallery.jsx): Manages the state for the fetched data (rickMortyData), which holds the array of characters retrieved from the Rick and Morty API.



### Page Routes: 
| URL Path | Component | Rendered Purpose |
|----------|-----------|------------------|
| `/` | Home.jsx | The main landing page or homepage. |
| `/game` | Game.jsx | Contains the Memory Matching Game logic and interface. |
| `/gallery` | Gallery.jsx | Displays the fetched Rick and Morty characters in a grid layout using the Axios API call. |
| `/leaderboard` | LeaderBoard.jsx | The intended page for scores and rankings, but instead there is a clever satire of the show |
| `*` | NotFound.jsx | Renders when the user navigates to any undefined path, catching broken links. |
